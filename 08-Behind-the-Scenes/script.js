// ************************************
// An High-Level Overview of Javascript
// ************************************

// Javascript is a high-level, prototype-based object oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class funtions and a non blocking event loop concurrency model!!!

// High-Level
//  - DOES NOT have to manually ask the computer for memory resources when creating a variable.
//  - These are called abstractions, they take all the work away from us. Makeing it nice and easy to learn/use!!
//  - Downside? Yes, not nearly as fast or as optimized as low level languages like C.

// Garbage-collected
//  - Is a memory management tool; is an algorithim inside of the javascript engine that removes old unused objects from computer memory.

// Interpreted or Just-in-Time Compiled language
//  - Converts our javascript into machine code(0s & 1s) inside the javascript engine

// Multi-Paradigm
//  - A paradigm is an approach and midset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique.
//    * Procedural programming
//    * Object-oriented programming(OOP)
//    * Funcitonal programming(FP)

// Prototype-based object-oriented
//  - Contains prewrtten object blue prints that have yet to have its classes defined.

// First-class functions
//  - Functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.

// Dynamic
//  - Refers to Dynamically typed laguages: We do not have to define the datatype when declaring variables and can be automatically changed.

// Non-Blocking Event Loop Conurrency Model in a Single Thread
//  - concurrency model: how the javascript engine handles mulitple tasks happening at the same time.
//  - Javascript runs on a single thread; can only do one thing at a time.
//  - Event loop takes long running tasks and executes them in the 'background', and puts them on main thread when finished!
